task1

The text is transmitted as input (we will assume that this is a certain standard document number in a given format).
The document number has the format xxxx-yyy-xxxx-yyy-xyxy, where x is any number, and y is a letter of the Latin alphabet (cannot be greater or less).
- Display the first two blocks of 4 digits in one inscription.
- Display the document number, but blocks of three letters are replaced with *** (each letter is replaced with *).
- Display only the letters from the document numbers in the format yyy/yyy/y/y in the registration record.
- Display the letters from the document number on the screen in the format “Letters: yyy/yyyy/y/y” in upper case (implemented using the StringBuilder class).
- Check the document number by length "abc" and display the message whether it contains or not (and abc and ABC are always considered the same).
- View whether the document number starts with the sequence 555.
- Look at the end of the document number at position 1a2b.
All these methods are implemented in a separate class in static methods, each task in a separate method.
The input methods (input parameter) will be entered into the input program table.


task2

Given a string of arbitrary length with arbitrary words.
Find the shortest word in a line and display it on the screen.
Find the longest word in a line and display it on the screen.
If there are several such words, then print the last one.

task3

An arbitrary string is given.
Print a new line to the console, which duplicates each letter from
starting line.
For example, "Hello" -> "HHeelllloo".
